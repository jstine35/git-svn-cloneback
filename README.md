# Quick Installation

My curently recommended way to install this onto your system for running is to first ensure
you have the following path added to your `PATH` (in many cases, this will already exist):

> ~/bin

From there you can quickly and easily export these functions from this git repository into
your PATH:

```
$ git --remote=https://github.com/jstine35/git-svn-cloneback archive master | tar -x -C ~/bin
```

# Developer Installation

Clone this somewhere, and add that dir to your `PATH`
